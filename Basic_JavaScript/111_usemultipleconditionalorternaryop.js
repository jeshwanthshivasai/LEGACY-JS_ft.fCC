/*
In the previous challenge, you used a single conditional operator.
You can also chain them together to check for multiple conditions.

The following function uses if, else if, and else statements to check multiple conditions:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return "a and b are equal";
  }
  else if (a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater";
  }
}

--> The above function can be re-written using multiple conditional operators:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" 
    : (a > b) ? "a is greater" 
    : "b is greater";
}
It is considered best practice to format multiple conditional operators such that each condition is on a separate line, as shown above.
Using multiple conditional operators without proper indentation may make your code hard to read.

For example:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" : (a > b) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
}
*/


function checkSign(num) {
  return (num > 0) ? "positive" : (num < 0) ? "negative" : "zero";
}

checkSign(10);
