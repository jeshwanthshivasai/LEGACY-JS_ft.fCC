You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

Here's how we would add a bark property to ourDog:

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
or
ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";

--> Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, bow-wow.

const myDog = {
  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};

myDog.bark = "woof";
myDog["bark"] = "woof";
