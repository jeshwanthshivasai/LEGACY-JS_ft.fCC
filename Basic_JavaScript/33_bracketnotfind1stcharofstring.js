/*
Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do.
They start at 0.
This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

const firstName = "Charles";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];

firstLetter would have a value of the string C.

// Setup
let firstLetterOfLastName = "";
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0]; // Change this line
