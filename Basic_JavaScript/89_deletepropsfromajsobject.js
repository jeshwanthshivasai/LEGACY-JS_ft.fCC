/*
We can also delete properties from objects like this: delete ourDog.bark;

Example:

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"],
  "bark": "bow-wow"
};
delete ourDog.bark;

--> After the last line shown above, ourDog looks like:

{
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
}
*/

// Setup
const myDog = {
  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"],
  "bark": "woof"
};

// Only change code below this line
delete myDog.tails;
delete myDog["tails"];
