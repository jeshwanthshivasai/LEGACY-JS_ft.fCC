/*
The console.log() method, which "prints" the output of what's within its parentheses to the console, will likely be the most helpful debugging tool.

--> Placing it at strategic points in your code can show you the intermediate values of variables.
--> It's good practice to have an idea of what the output should be before looking at what it is.
--> Having check points to see the status of your calculations throughout your code will help narrow down where the problem is.

--> Here's an example to print the string Hello world! to the console:

console.log('Hello world!');
*/

let a = 5;
let b = 1;
a++;
// Only change code below this line
console.log(a);

let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);
