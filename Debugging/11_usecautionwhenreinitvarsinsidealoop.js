/*
Sometimes it's necessary to save information, increment counters, or re-set variables within a loop.

A potential issue is when variables either should be reinitialized, and aren't, or vice versa.
This is particularly dangerous if you accidentally reset the variable being used for the terminal condition, causing an infinite loop.

Printing variable values with each cycle of your loop by using console.log() can uncover buggy behavior related to resetting, or failing to reset a variable.
